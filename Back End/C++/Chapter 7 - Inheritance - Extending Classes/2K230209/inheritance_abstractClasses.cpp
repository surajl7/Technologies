// Inheritance

/*
Abstract Classes:
    An abstract class is one that is not used to create objects. An abstract class is 
    designed only to act as a base class (to be inherited by other classes).
    It is a design concept in  program development and provides a base class upon which
    other classes may be built. In the previous example, the student class is an abstract
    class since it was not used to  create any objects.
