// Inheritance 

/*
Hirarchical Inheritance :
    We have deiscussed so far the inheritance can be used to mmodify a class
    when it did not satisfy the requirments of a perticular problem on hand.
    Additional members are added through inheritance to extend the capabilities 
    of a class. Another intresting application of inheritance is to use it as a support
    to the hirarchical design of a program. 
    Many programming problems can be cast into a hierarchy where certain features of one
    level are shared by many others below that level.
