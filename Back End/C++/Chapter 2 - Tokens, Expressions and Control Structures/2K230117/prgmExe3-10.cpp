// Programming Exercise 3.10

/*

An electricity board charges the following rates to deomestic users to discourage
large consumption of energy:
For the first 100 units     - 60p per unit
For next 200 units          - 80p per unit
Beyound 300 units           - 90p per unit

All users are changed a minimum of Rs. 50.00, if the total amount is more than 
Rs. 300.00  then an additional surcharge of 15% is added.

Write a program to read the names of users and numbers of units consumed and print
out the charges with names.
