// Programming Exercise 3.5

/*
An election is contested by five candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5
and the voting is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper.

Write a program to read the ballots and count the votes cast for each candidate using and array
variable count. In case, a number read is outside the range 1 to 5, the ballot should be considered
as a 'spoilt ballot', and the program should also count the number of spoilt ballots.
